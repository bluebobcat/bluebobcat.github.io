As a modern musician, active since 1995, Yann Tiersen has established an iconic sound that transcends his time. The French artist’s compositions often remind listeners of a past Paris, largely influenced by his soundtrack for the 2001 French film Amélie. His other movie scores and studio albums include additional evocative pieces like “Childhood,” “The Day Before,” and “The Waltz of the Old Bones.” The song titles themselves hint towards Tiersen’s reminiscent quality and ability to transport his audience to a different time. With a combination of classic, contemporary, and unexpected instruments, Tiersen records, produces, and sometimes performs his works alone. Tiersen’s method of creation is therefore largely made possible by the use of electronic music tools. For example, he is able to layer solo instrument tracks to create full songs with sound editing softwares. To understand Tiersen’s artistry, we take notice of his nostalgic sound and its connection to new technology. The relation may seem counterintuitive, but the evolution of sound technology has allowed artists like Tiersen to realize their musical visions.

When reflecting on his artistic history, Tiersen claims to have rediscovered music after experimenting with his first synth, a Roland Juno-106. Having studied the piano and violin as a child, his traditional musical grounding expanded when he “experimented at the outer limits of industrial electronic music and then discovered minimalism” in his twenties (Buchanan). This reimagined approach allows Tiersen to challenge structure and agency as he creates. This is evident in his choice of instruments—specifically his choice to use objects that would not normally classify as instruments. For example, Tiersen has been known to utilize typewriters, toy telephones, and bicycle wheels to evoke memories or visions which contribute to the impact of his work (“Yann Tiersen - an Overview of the Composer, His Film Music and Albums”). Each of these items have purposes outside of music, and as Tiersen strays from these conventions, he exercises broader musical agency. Tiersen combines the raw sounds, known as musique concrète, with classical elements to create a nostalgic atmosphere and step outside the structural bounds of classical music. A song becomes more than a melody when it captures the sounds of a physical environment which aligns with Stephen J. Klien’s definition of technology: a system that extends human ability to sense various aspects of the world around us (Klien 211). For many, music—especially instrumental or classical genred music—is associated with the piano, strings, etc. When discussing keyboard culture in Shaping the Synthesizer it is noted that when promoting instruments “it looks good if you’re playing a keyboard. People understand that then you are creating music” (Pinch and Trocco 258). Tiersen challenges the debate between traditional and reimagined music by blurring the line between the two. By creating classic tunes all the while reinterpreting the limits of what makes an instrument, he proves that new technology belongs in music and evolves what it is able to achieve. 

New recording technology has also contributed to Tiersen’s extension of time and sound. In Chapter One of Capturing Sound, Mark Katz explores several phonograph effects that hold true to Tiersen’s creative process. Consider the repeatability of a piece before and after music recording became a possibility (Katz 24). As Tiersen himself puts it, “as long as a song is recorded, it’s alive when someone listens to it” (Aquarium Drunkard). When Tiersen includes snippets of field recordings from the French coast, he alters the way these sounds are circulated and received. It is virtually impossible to perfectly replicate a sound or note, but recordings allow Tiersen to preserve and share these experiences. This heavily contributes to his potential to compose nostalgic creations. Nostalgia often relates to periods or places with personal associations, and by capturing the sounds of these spaces, Tiersen is able to induce nostalgia. And while technology has expanded Tiersen’s abilities as an artist, there are also instances of musicians adjusting to technology’s boundaries. Katz discusses temporality and the history of artists cutting their music according to time limits. We can consider radio edits as an example (Katz 32). This is not necessarily a drawback and Tiersen credits this effect for keeping his music dynamic. When it comes to performances and the boundaries of live play and venue sound systems, Tiersen is “constantly working on new versions and remixes from the album because [he] wants to be able to play in big venues, but small clubs, as well. So it’s a wide reinterpretation of the album” (Taylor). His music is open to evolution and change while preserving its evocative spirit. There is something to be said about music that grows with an audience just as nostalgia acts on aging individuals.

As Tiersen composes music with an “old” or reminiscent quality, we come to understand that his music would not be possible without recent circumstances. His performances, for instance, are sometimes solo efforts. When asked about performing multi instrument pieces alone, Tiersen says he “did work a lot to be able to do what [he does] on the album live, so it’s quite a big electronic set up” (Taylor). During his Eura tour, Tiersen opened the show at the piano while “accompanied by loud ambient field recordings (ocean waves, wind noises, birdsong) sourced from the Breton coast where [he] grew up” (Lewis). Updated venue sound systems support this performance and share the coastal sounds around the world. This kind of preparation identifies with the 1923 piece, “Ballet Mecanique” and Paul Lehrman’s live performance decades later. Antheil, the original composer, had a vision that included sixteen tightly syncronized player pianos. However technical obstacles made this impossible at the time. It was not until Lehrman’s time that “what Antheil so desperately needed, [Lehrman had]: MIDI (musical instrument digital interface)” (Lehrman 2). Likewise, Tiersen is able to share his pieces live because modern technology has caught up to his musical intentions. To achieve the full effect of his music when performing independently would be impossible if not for the electronic tools he tours with. Tiersen’s sentimental sound is shared past physical and timely limits thanks to technology.

Yann Tiersen captures audiences with music that inspires imagery and memory. He uses musique concrète as technology to build scenes and remind listeners of the past or various physical environments. This emotional connection is part of what makes Tiersen such a powerful artist. His skilled and creative mind is assisted by technology throughout the entire creative process, extending his existing artistic capacity. In this essay, Tiersen’s use of unconventional instruments, sound editing, and electronic performances were explored to better understand how music’s evolution through the digital age has influenced musicians. We see technology assisting artists like Tiersen who choose to compose, record, and produce alone. This broadens what a musician is able to create. More sounds can be captured and edited as well, which broadens what music can include. Tiersen’s music is evidence that new tools do not sacrifice classic sound and the same quality or overall emotional impact can be acheived. As music continues to evolve, Tiersen shows that there is a future for nostalgic sound.
