### For Context...
This writeup was written at the conclusion of my STS class on Musical Algorithms in Society. Throughout the course we explored the societal context of data collection and analytics with an emphasis on machine learning algorithms for music. I reference several readings from the course and have cited them below. 

As a Data Science major, I have chosen to minor in STS (Science, Technology, and Society Studies) because I recognize the responsability that comes with data handling. Data should be collected and used in an ethical manner to truly serve people! 

### What is Data?
Simply put, data is a collection of observable information. The key component of this definition is the word “observable.” My view of data has shifted over the course of this semester and I now consider, ironically, what is excluded from data as one of its most important components. In week one, the Seaver piece described context as “that unquantified remainder that haunts mathematical models, making numbers that appear to be identical actually different from each other” (Seaver 1104). Data can record certain figures and statistics while failing to accurately portray why they exist. Data is not naturally accumulated material and it is important to remember the invasive possibilities of dataveillance when defining it. New “technologies – especially ones integrated into your everyday, personal life – generates reams of data that would otherwise be out of reach to the companies that want it” (Sadowski 6). Therefore the word “observable” does not mean necessarily clear or evident. This deep search for data makes it very valuable to companies for example. I have often heard the claim that “data is the new gold” and exploring the practice of data collection clarifies why that is. I think the definition of data must also consider the monetary value of data. In Gilliard’s lecture, it was explained that major corporations like Google, use their user’s data as a product for other companies to target ads and information.

Throughout this course, we especially focused on the meaning of online data. Like my general definition of data, online data is a collection of observable internet behaviors. In regards to online activity, data creates “data doubles” of its users. The concept of data doubles was explored in multiple readings this semester, most of which ultimately agree that “data doubles” are often misrepresented versions of individuals. This occurs when "data doubles are commodified, capitalized, collected, celebrated, and often out of the control of those they represent" (Bouk 85). Data is not easily defined when considering the important history and implications of it.
